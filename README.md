# Live Wallpaper Template

Use this template to help create live wallpapers for Android.
Note this is for live wallpapers that use the [`Canvas`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Canvas) and not OpenGL.

## Files you need to edit

* `ExampleWallpaperDrawer`
This is the class that draws the wallpaper

* `ExampleWallpaperService`
This class provides the name of the drawer class

* `SettingsActivity` and `activity_settings.xml`
This activity allows the user to change settings for the wallpaper

* `wallpaper.xml`
This xml file is read by other apps to provide the user access to the live wallpaper

* `wallpaper_thumbnail.png`
This is preview of the wallpaper used by wallpaper listing apps

* `release.jks`, `release.properties`, `strings.xml`, `ic_launcher*`, `build.gradle`, and the package name
These are the usual Android files and should be updated to match your app

### There are TODOs in the app for all these steps

## Template files

The files in the `template` package probably don't need to be edited and are mostly used to provided the drawer to the settings activity and the launcher. 
They have javadoc explaining their purpose in more detail in each file.
